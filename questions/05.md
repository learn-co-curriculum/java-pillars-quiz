# Polymorphism

```java
public class Vehicle  {
    public void horn() { System.out.println("honk"); }
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void horn() {System.out.println("beep");}
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Truck();
        v.horn();
    }
}
```

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

## Incorrect

honk

> Incorrect.  The variable `v` references an instance of class `Truck`.
> Due to dynamic binding, Java executes the method based on the type
> of the object `Truck`, not the declared type of the variable `Vehicle`.
> The correct output is:    
> beep

## Correct

beep

> Correct!  The variable `v` references an instance of class `Truck`.
