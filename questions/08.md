# Super

```java
public class Vehicle  {
    public void horn() { System.out.println("toot"); }
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    private boolean v8Engine;
}

public class FastTruck extends Truck {
    @Override
    public void horn() {
        super.horn();
        System.out.println("honk");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FastTruck t = new FastTruck();
        t.horn();
    }
}
```

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

## Incorrect

`Truck` does not override the `honk()`
method so the code won't compile due to the call `super.honk();`

> Incorrect. 
> Since `Truck` does not override the `honk()` method, `Truck`
> inherits the method from its superclass `Vehicle`.  The call
> `super.honk();` will invoke the method inherited from the `Vehicle` superclass.
> The correct output is:   
> toot   
> honk


## Correct

toot<br>
honk
