# Inheritance

What is printed when the `main` method executes?

```java
public class Vehicle  {
    public void horn() { System.out.println("honk"); }
    public void drive() { System.out.println("vroom"); }
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void horn() {System.out.println("beep");}
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Truck t = new Truck();
        t.horn();
        t.drive();
    }
}
```

## Correct

beep    
vroom

> Correct!  The `Truck` class inherits method `drive()` from the `Vehicle` class
> and overrides the `horn()` method.


## Incorrect

honk   
vroom

> Incorrect.  The `Truck` class inherits method `drive()` from the `Vehicle` class
> and overrides the `horn()` method. The correct output is:    
> beep   
> vroom



## Incorrect

The code won't compile because Truck does not define a method named drive.

> Incorrect.  The `Truck` class inherits method `drive()` from the `Vehicle` class
> and overrides the `horn()` method. The correct output is:    
> beep   
> vroom
