# Abstraction

```java
public abstract class Vehicle  {
  public void horn() {System.out.println("beep");}
}

public interface Drivable {
  void drive();
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle implements Drivable {
  @Override
  public void drive() {
    System.out.println("vroom");
  }
}
```

Select each assignment statement that compiles without an error.

## Correct

`Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();`

> Incorrect.  `Vehicle` is an abstract class that can't be instantiated.

## Correct

`Truck t1 = new Truck();`

> Correct!

## Correct

`Vehicle v2 = new Truck();`

> Correct! `Truck` is a subclass of `Vehicle`.  A variable declared with the superclass type
> can be assigned to an object of the subclass type.

## Incorrect

`Drivable d1 = new Drivable();`

> Incorrect.  `Drivable` is an interface and can't be instantiated.

## Correct

`Drivable d2 = new Truck();`

> Correct! `Truck` implements the `Drivable` interface.  A variable declared with the interface type
> can be assigned to an object of a class that implements the interface.
